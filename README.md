## Project: The Document Classification with NLP

### Multi-Class Text Clasification of make-up cosmetics
 
### General info

The project concerns document classification using natural language processing. The analysis includes the multi-class text classification, Topic Modeling and previous analysis of makeup products.

The dataset comes from http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/ and has been obtained from my previous project at [Create dataset with API](https://github.com/aniass/Create-dataset-with-API).

The multi-class text classification has been applied to categorization of the description of makeup products by using python, NLTK library and Machine Learning algorithms.

The Topic modeling includes LDA analysis from our dataset. The analysis of makeup products includes data exploration, data aggregation and cleaning data. 

### Analysis includes:
* analysis of makeup products
* multi-class text classification with nltk library and Machine Learning algorithms
* LDA - Topic modeling with Gensim library

The project is created with:

* Python 3
* libraries: nltk, gensim, sklearn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, pyLDAvis.
