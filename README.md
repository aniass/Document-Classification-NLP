## Multi-Class Text Classification for products based on their description
 
### General info

The project includes multi-class text classification with Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, text classification with Doc2vec model, creation Word2vec model, Topic Modeling (with LDA analysis) and EDA analysis (data exploration, data aggregation and cleaning data).

The dataset comes from http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/ and has been obtained from my previous project at [Extracting Data using API](https://github.com/aniass/Extracting-data-using-API).

### Motivation

The aim of the project is multi-class text classification to make-up products based on their description and categories. Based on given text as an input, we have predicted what would be the category. We have five types of categories corresponding to different makeup products. We used different machine learning algorithms to get more accurate predictions and choose the most accurate one for our issue.
